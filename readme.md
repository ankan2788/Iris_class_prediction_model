ðŸŒ¸ Iris Classification Prediction Model
The Iris Classification Prediction Model is a machine learning project that uses supervised learning techniques to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, based on features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

This classic dataset, introduced by Sir Ronald Fisher, is widely used as a beginner-friendly introduction to classification tasks in machine learning. In this project, we build and evaluate models like Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and others to predict the species of iris flowers with high accuracy. The goal is to demonstrate end-to-end ML workflow: from data preprocessing and visualization to model training, evaluation, and prediction.
